My name is Vic Yeh. I'm a founder, engineer, and investor.

I am currently working at [Oyster](https://www.withoyster.com/), an insurance technology company aiming to redesign insurance from the ground up. I also invest in early stage startups at [Polymath](https://polymathcp.com), a pre-seed/seed focused fund.

Here are my areas of interest:
- **Engineering**: distributed systems, machine intelligence
- **Investing**: insurtech/fintech, B2C/B2B software, developer tools
- **Books**: check out my [bookshelf](http://vicyeh.com/books.html)
